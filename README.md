# graphicsTUT2



For challange 2 i created a material and added an image to it.

the material used the default shader that comes when you create the shader within the project.

within that material i was able to change the rgb values without changing the textures.



For challenge 4 in order to add a new texture layer i duplicated the texture within the shader graph then created a new 2d texture for it to attach to
